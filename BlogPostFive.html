		<h2>Data Art, Data Visualisation and Representalional Strategies</h2>

		<article class = "blog-post  h-feed">

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				Both Data Visualization and Data Art include the depiction of data. However, while Data Art has no constraints or standards that must be followed, Data Visualisation is the polar opposite. Data visualisation is the graphical representation of data with the purpose of facilitating access to information, boosting data readability, and encouraging information literacy. In this paper, I will examine briefly the differences between Data Visualisation and Data Art, as well as their parallels. To explore the representational strategies employed by both mediums, I will refer to the following works: Representation by Jenny Kidd (2015), Artistic Data Visualisation: Beyond Visual Analytics by Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg (2007), and How Art Can Contribute to Ethical Reflections on Risky Technologies by Sabine Roeser (2016).			</p>

				Data visualization is the depiction of data using standard images like charts, plots, infographics, and even animations (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). These informational visualizations convey complicated data relationships and data-driven insights in an easily comprehensible manner.

			</p>

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				Data visualization can be used for a variety of objectives, and it is crucial to remember that its application is not limited to data teams. Organisations also uses it to communicate organizational structure and hierarchy, whilst data analysts and data scientists employ it to identify and explain patterns (Viegas and Wattenberg, 2007). In the preceding ten years, a second, vastly distinct sort of information visualization has flourished. Although the scientific visualization community is familiar with the fundamental tools employed by these artists, their motivations and creations are novel. A reasonable inquiry is why this new sort of visualization (or this new artistic style) has emerged. Any response to this topic is speculative, but two specific considerations are pertinent. Viegas and Wattenberg attribute this to the emergence of software tools suitable for the aesthetic generation of data visualizations is the first development (Viejas and Wattenberg, 2007).  It is possible to design powerful visualization software utilizing inexpensive hardware and user-friendly development platforms, such as Flash (www.adobe.com) (Viegas and Wattenburg, 2007). Data's incorporation into the cultural discourse on multiple levels is a second factor. The Internet can be considered as a big database. Moreover, government and corporate data gathering increasingly play a pivotal role in the lives of the residents of numerous nations.

				In this week’s task, we were set out to work on some type of data art, as long as we could find meaning in it and give a good explanation. This was no easy task, as I had no one clue about data art and what it encompasses. However, in the readings done and further research done, I gathered that a good place to start with constructing data art, is to start by data visualisation. This seemed like a good starting point as it allowed me to think about how I wanted to display the data, and what context or narrative I wanted it to be a part of to relay on to the audience. Looking at examples such as Aaron Koblin’s, Flight Patterns and Jonathan Harris and Sepandar Kamvar, We feel fine, I knew that I wanted the data that I would be working with to be something meaningful while conveying it in an artistic and explorative manner.As a result, it is only natural for artists to want to explore the difficulties highlighted by the dominating power of the data (Viegas and Wattenburg, 2007).

				Data Art is an artistic practice based on the use of data sets to convey emotions and information (Benzi, 2020). This relates to Roeser's article on the work of techno-art, or art that reflects and interacts with dangerous technologies (Roeser, 2016). This article demonstrates that this form of art elicits emotional reactions and may provoke ethical considerations. This makes perfect sense, as art has historically been the foundation for experiencing art, and the development of emotional experiences has frequently been said to be the objective of artistic expression. In addition, it does not rely only on the artist's imagination; it is grounded in objective truth. Additionally, the audience must be able to comprehend the data artwork (Benzi, 2020). It differs from Data visualisation, which seeks to be the most efficient method of translating data into visual objects and to reduce distortions, as they may impede analysis. Although Data Art communicates information, it is mainly concerned with expressing a point of view (Viegas and Wattenburg, 2007).

				With Data Art, a narrative is told; hence, a message is a requirement of Data Art, like Data visualisation. This can be accomplished by the use of shapes, colours, and descriptive language. In terms of data art, a description is crucial so that viewers may acquire insight and interact with the artwork; otherwise, it would be abstract art, allowing users to create their own interpretation. Even though audience interpretation is welcomed, the objective nature of data art's message is its defining characteristic.

			<p class = "blog1-text">
			Now that I've delved a little more into these two mediums, it's evident that they share a commonality, namely the conveyance of a message generated from a data set and the representational nature of this message. A representation involves the audience in the creation of its meaning. In data visualization and data art, representation becomes highly crucial. Data visualisation is the graphical depiction of information and data, and by employing visual elements such as charts, graphs, and maps, data visualisation tools give an accessible means of seeing and comprehending data trends, anomalies, and structures (Kidd, 2015). In contrast, Data Art is the artistic portrayal of data utilizing visual components like colours, objects, and even animations. Herein lies the relevance of Stuart Hall's Theory of Representation (Kidd, 2015). His thesis holds that there is no real portrayal of individuals or events in a text, but that there are numerous ways in which they might be portrayed. Therefore, producers attempt to "fix" a meaning (or way of knowing) for individuals or events in their writings and visuals (Kidd, 2015). As we carry mental representations in our minds, conceptual maps play a substantial and essential role in Data Visualisation representation. The employment of graphical primitives in data visualization was a compelling argument made by Kidd in her article (Kidd, 2015). After pondering why this would be the case, despite the fact that the technologies deployed on the back end of the data visualizations are considered "advanced," I realized that these "graphical primitives" have a role in our society and contribute to our mental conceptualizations (Kidd, 2015). This allows for a more natural association between the audience and these graphic primitives. The usage of charting tools such as a bar chart is a simple example I can provide. Since bar charts have been around for a long time, they have formed a conceptual representation of numerical values. If there were different colours of bars, one would automatically group them and separate them from other colours – this gives meaning to the bar chart as a whole, as one colour represents one thing, and another represents another.

				In Saussure's linguistic theory, a sign is a link between the signified (a notion) and the signifier (a sound, text, image), both of which are psychological creations with non-material substance and form. This is often expressed as signifier + signified = sign (Kidd, 2015). For example, the word tree or an image of a tree is a signifier for the concept of the entity we refer to as a tree. The resulting symbol connects the sound pattern to the notion. This idea is significant because the producer (the addresser in semiotic language) and the consumer (the addressee) must communicate contextual knowledge for good meaning construction to occur. In Peirce's semiotics, meaning is mediated in such a way that "the meaning of a sign is not contained within it but emerges in its interpretation" with a mental notion. Peirce's semiotics is founded on a triadic relationship consisting of:
			
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				• The object: the thing to be represented (this does not need to have a material form); 
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				• The representamen: the form that the sign takes (word, sound, image, etc.); the representamen represents the object.
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				
				• The interpretant: our interpretation of the sign
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				In both Saussure's and Pierce's systems, there is an object (the signified) that is meant to be represented, a signifier (which attempted to symbolize the object), and, most importantly, a mental construct that binds the two together and permits interpretation(Kidd, 2015). In Data Visualization, the chart is a representation of the data, but the interpretant is the concept produced in our minds when we read the chart representation and recognize various indications - this is how we assign meaning to the chart.
			</p>
				
			
			
			   

			
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				This also applies to Data Art; objects, symbols, words, and colours have value because they are part of a system or a set of codes. They have significance within our culture, and we may make sense of them based on their distinctions and similarities. In Data Art, it is essential that the signs and symbols are deciphered in order to analyse and make sense of the data, and this can only be done if the physical form and context of the thing are known. The background of the artwork I created, for instance, resembles a galaxy, indicating that it is set in space. The users then identify or make sense of the planets by first identifying it as a circle, then by its colours, and finally by its environment. Mars (signified) can be identified based on its name, which belongs to a collection of classification terms for planets. Without the context, it would be useless and the association between the universe and planet would not take place. This is how Data Art and Data Visualization reflect the world.

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				In conclusion, I've emphasized the distinctions and parallels between Data Visualisation and Data Art. In addition, I have elaborated on the representational tactics utilized by both of these media to convey and represent data.
