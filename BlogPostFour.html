		<h2>Data Art Implementation Essay</h2>

		<article class = "blog-post  h-feed blog-four" >

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				The goal of data art is to produce attractive shapes and creative works from the digital nature of big data sets (graphics, simulations, worksheets, statistics, etc.). Our environment's virtual data can be converted into images, objects, or sounds. Data art also demonstrates the underlying connections that exist between the pervasive algorithms in our lives — numbers from databases, raw data, data obtained by search engines, computations and statistics (geographic, political, meteorological, and financial) and creative production (Grugier, .et al, 2016).

				As corporations, local governments, and public agencies are increasingly compelled to develop visually appealing and stunning methods to classify the data created by population migrations, purchase patterns, communication trends, travel habits, etc., data visualization has emerged as a core field. In the realm of data art, deciding how to view this data is the first step. Theorist Edward Tufte, who developed sparklines (a brief graphic format designed for insertion in text), and Ben Shneiderman, who developed the treemap in 1990, are two of the forerunners of this field, which was previously exclusively scientific and focused on graphical representations of statistical data. Bar charts, pie charts (also known as Camembert or Donut charts), and line graphs are some of the other methods and terms used in graphical representation. They all refer to the different ways of making visually attractive and, above all, understandable the reams of data (also called “datascapes”) that shape our everyday lives (Grugier, .et al, 2016).

				When used to create exceedingly complex visualizations, data visualization may occasionally take on an aesthetic quality. For instance, Matt Willey uses similar shapes in his works, At This Rate and 2060 Poster to illustrate the effects of the economy and human activity on the environment

				In this week’s task, we were set out to work on some type of data art, as long as we could find meaning in it and give a good explanation. This was no easy task, as I had no one clue about data art and what it encompasses. However, in the readings done and further research done, I gathered that a good place to start with constructing data art, is to start by data visualisation. This seemed like a good starting point as it allowed me to think about how I wanted to display the data, and what context or narrative I wanted it to be a part of to relay on to the audience. Looking at examples such as Aaron Koblin’s, Flight Patterns and Jonathan Harris and Sepandar Kamvar, We feel fine, I knew that I wanted the data that I would be working with to be something meaningful while conveying it in an artistic and explorative manner.

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				This brings me to the next definition I found of interactive data visualisation found on HAYVIW, interactive data visualisation refers to the use of modern data analysis software that enables users to directly manipulate and explore graphical representations of data. Which I firmly believe that s what interactive data visualisation is all about.  Interactivity is the ideal solution for large amounts of data with complex data stories.  A static data visualisation is one that does not incorporate any interaction capabilities and does not change with times, such as infographics focused on a specific data which only shows a single viewpoint. It is essential to give great consideration about what data is being displayed and from what viewpoint. A static data visualisation is more suited to convey predetermined view rather than encouraging exploration and increasing user autonomy. I think that data visualisations should have the intent to cater to human experience and goals, which is what makes part of interactive data visualisation, the ability to explore and find trends that are required by the user, but also the intent to be engaging and playful. This aspect is often introduced through tools from software systems that give the user a variety of options to make the data more engaging and accessible, such as filtering and zooming in on certain areas of interests.

			<p class = "blog-caption">	What I liked about how We feel fine, was its interconnectedness. It conveyed the message of millions of feelings all originating from one point and then dispersing. The common field was the phrase, “I feel” or “I am feeling”. I also really like different colours used with the circles, which one can assume relate to different types of feelings.

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				The data that I wanted to represent is the data that shows the correlation found between A nation’s per capita income and life expectancy. Below are the steps that guided me in the planning of the Data art.

			</p>
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				1) What do you want to represent?

					The main aspect of this data art is visualizing the relationship between per capita income and life expectancy. It should show the relationship between countries and their per capita income and overall life expectancy. This is an interesting case study showing whether per capita income affects life expectancy. Money really extends our years as a nation, right? However, I found that the data provided apparently did not include factors such as disease and mortality...but it is a good starting point for visualizing something in art form.

				2) How would you like this to appear?
The shape chosen here is a circle. I could have used other types of shapes or lines to convey this, but I thought shapes were the best because they could represent data in different ways. This makes the different colors used to assign different colors to different countries clearer and more distinguishable, as well as the different sizes assigned to different circles representing the populations of different countries. For these reasons, I thought the circle was a great shape. Because the circle is a symbolic shape when it comes to the concept of life. A closed circle is said to resemble the beginning and end of life, and no matter how different the circles are in size and color, the end is the same for everyone: death.

				I used data visualization as a starting point for creating data art. While I haven't decided yet whether I'll keep the line chart to show key metrics like life expectancy and per capita income, I decoded the data this way and used it to create a narrative. This way the data can be read and interpreted. What should it be about, right? However, after reading an article by Kirel Benzi, he claims that data art uses data sets to convey emotion and that the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and not just the artist's since it is based on data (Benzi, 2020). In addition, he further asserts that the data used to create the play should be reasonably understandable to the audience, with adequate explanations, even if the meaning is not obvious at first glance (Benzi, 2020). Something he finally mentioned that caught my eye and helped me decide if I really wanted this data art displayed through a line graph was that he made a distinction between data art, data visualization, and generative art. Data visualization attempts to be an effective representation of data in visuals, and generative art relies on randomness, often found in nature, to evoke emotion (Benzi, 2020). The path I took led more into the field of data visualization, which, with sufficient explanation, could also be called data art. I’m strictly instructed to make data art. By data art I am referring to visualizations of data primarily aimed at entertaining or creating an aesthetic experience. It is art based on data. As such, we can judge its merits as we do with art in general. It's all about the aesthetic experience and coming to this conclusion I realized that I initially wanted my art to be as effective as the data visualization in relaying the data, and so I concluded that I shouldn't if it's all about the aesthetic experience and the pleasure it generates. Is anyone worried about how accurately or effectively I am reporting the data given? Instead, I should create something that encompasses the dataset and its narrative. This is where the idea of explanation and exploration comes into play. According to Riche et al. data-driven stories contain both explanatory and exploratory facets that can be integrated with each other to varying degrees, and an example of this would be the flexibility an artist would offer their audience and the interpretation suggested (Riche et al, 2020). I really wanted to incorporate that into this data art as I wanted to give users a context of where the data art resides and give them the flexibility to come up with their own ideas and their own interpretations and analysis of the data (Riche et al, 2020). So I think that based on the current sketch I have right now, I should work on balancing how much information should be presented to the audience versus how much information should be left out so that the audience can make their own interpretations and not have my data art feels too much like data visualization where the information is as clear as day and there is no room for other opinions, emotions and creativity (Benzi, 2020).

				The rough sketch above shows how I envision my data art. Regarding the aesthetics of the art itself, tiny decisions still need to be made, e.g., should I have a key to represent what the different colors mean. On the other hand, I could always exclude the key and leave it as it is and let the audience know what they are representing through a brief explanation. Another aspect I'm considering is putting in some animation or some sort of playthrough. This allows the audience to see all the circles starting at 0 and moving to their respective values. This would make the overall aesthetic experience even more enjoyable, in my opinion
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				In summary, the articles and principles I've gone through have really shaped my current work into what it is now. As far as progress goes, I'm not exactly happy with what I have now and I know I can work with different techniques to maybe improve the data art, but for now I think it will be enough. There are still aspects I need to work on, such as the concept of explanation and exploration in data art. I need to find a way to balance the two in my artwork.
