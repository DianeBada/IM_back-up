		<h2>Interactive Data Visualisation </h2>

		<article class = "blog-post" slot="e-content recent posts" aria-roledescription="blog entries">

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				In this essay, I will make use of the reading, but mostly the video conference made by Dimara and Perin that focuses on what data visualisation is really about. On top of that, I will make use of different sources to back up and build up on my thoughts and ideas around data visualisation.
			</p>
			<p class = "blog1-text">
				The Oxford dictionary defines interactivity as "computer or other device that permits information to be transferred constantly and in both directions between a computer or other device and the person who uses it" (OxfordLearnersDictionary). When the terms interactive data visualisation is broken down, one may deduce that data visualisation is interactive when information moves between the data visualisation and the person using it. This might include both human input and computer output. Perin describes interactive data visualization interaction as "the interplay between a person and a data interface including data-relayed intent" (Dimara & Perin, 2019).  Dimara writes on how the duo arrived at this description after realizing that most academic books developed a general perspective of interaction in data visualization, one in which interaction is viewed as a dialogue between an "analyst" and a "visual system" (Dimara & Perin, 2019).  
			</p>


			<p class = "blog1-text">
				The authors see this as restrictive because there is seldom study done on interaction in the context of data visualization, and when it is done, it is primarily focused on implementation than the underlying design. Second, they contend that there is a reductionist and outmoded notion about the modalities that users might employ in terms of data visualization, namely that data visualization is always digitally based (Dimara & Perin, 2020). This sentence elicits two opposing reactions in me. To begin with, data may be represented in a variety of ways that do not include digital goods or are not computer-based. However, it's difficult to foresee non-computer-based data becoming interactive. 
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				The goal of interactive data is to use graphics to help analysts grasp the significance of data in an efficient and effective manner. Interactivity software enables the ability to adjust data visualisation parameters, provide new insights, capture full value, isolate and visualize information for extended periods of time. So, how can we bring interactivity to non-computer-based data visualization? Unfortunately, I cannot answer that question now. Going back to Prima's description, "data-related-intent" was a significant phrase in their definition, and one would wonder what "data-related-intent" actually means (Dimara & Perin, 2019). Perin and Dimara feel that there is no shared understanding of what purpose is and how it functions in the visualisation process. 
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				This gives rise to many views on the topic. The first is that purpose isn't personalized or customized to human experience since too much emphasis is placed on data, tasks, and domains they occupy, rather than human aims. On the other side, others argue that we place too much emphasis on operationalizing intent and neglect involvement and fun. This leads me to the following definition of interactive data visualisation that I discovered on Heavy.AI: interactive data visualisation refers to the use of current data analysis tools that allows users to actively alter and examine graphical representations of data (Heavy.AI, 2022). That, I feel, is what interactive data visualization is all about.
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				For vast volumes of data with complicated data stories, interactivity is the right answer. A static data visualization is one that does not allow for interaction and does not change over time, such as infographics centered on a certain data set that only provides a single point of view. It is critical to think carefully about what data is being shown and from what perspective. A static data visualization is more suited to conveying a present picture than promoting exploration and boosting user autonomy (Synergy Codes, 2021). I believe that data visualizations should have the aim to cater to human experience and objectives, which is what makes interactive data visualization possible, as well as the capacity to explore and identify trends that the user requires, as well as the desire to be engaging and entertaining. This component is frequently provided by software system tools that provide the user with a range of alternatives for making the data more interesting and accessible, such as filtering and zooming in on certain regions of interest (Heavy.AI, 2022).
			</p>

			<p class = "blog1-text">
				Finally, interactive data visualization takes use of human visual perception and cognition to increase the accuracy and efficacy of data analysis. When combined with the processing capacity of machines and human strength, challenges that neither technique alone can address are solved. Furthermore, the ability to present the most recent trend is a huge benefit of interactive visualisation, which leads to well-informed judgments. In general, data visualisations enable organizations to vary how they present data. This leads to a more in-depth knowledge and more specialized analysis, which might result in fresh discoveries and unexpected outcomes.
