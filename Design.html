								<p slot = "font-text">In terms of the font, I went with the font Playfair Display as I thought it was a font that screamed, "elegant" and "exclusive", which perfectly describes the theme of my website. Across the site, I have tried to stick to this font to create a consistency with regards to the font. This was done, to try and implement convention or appease to the expectdness of the users.

								<p>My website appeals to upper class individuals as it offers the finest and most elegant pieces of jewelry. In reltion to that aspect, I went with the colours, black and gold. Black is a classic colour and Gold is often associated with jewelry or expensie taste. I thought the colour of the scheme would suit the the theme of the website, as these two powerful colours provide a good contrast as well.</p>

								<p>Pictures speak thousands of words. I included images of "expensive" looking jewelry that I thought would fit well with the overall message and theme of the website. I think it's a good visual cue as seeing as always believing. I made use of multiple images and videos of jewlery from necklaces, to earings, to rings. This further added to the aesthetic of the website.

						In represnting data in the form of visuals, I decided to go with the tree map.
						A treemap is a visual method for displaying hierarchical data that uses nested rectangles to represent the branches of a tree diagram. Each rectangles has an area proportional to the amount of data it represents. 

					</p>
					<figure class = "u-photo"  slot = "tree-data">

					</p>
					<p class = "title-explain">Explaination</p>

					<p class = "data-explain"  >

						The two data visualizations I've made in the Data Visualisation section, is a representation of movies data as well as games data. The Video game data set represents the top 100 video game sales and is grouped by the platform. Users can ready this tree map by looking at the categories which are all shaded by unique colours that is also displayed in the key section at the bottom. In each catergory of platform, the squares differ in size based on the value of the games. The most sold game in each group will have a large section of space in the square compared to the lowest or other games sales that are smaller in comparison.

						The same thing can be said for the movie data-set. This represents the top 100 highest grossing films grouped by genre. In each genre category, there are squares that differ in size and this is a representation of their values. The movie with the biggest space or square in that genre category, is the highest grossing movie within their category and the oppsoite applies for the smallest sqaure.
